These sets of scripts will install libCEC on your raspberry-pi 1. LibCEC is a tool
to control CEC devices with. CEC is often included in HDMI nowadays and it permits
one to actually control the device. For instance, let's say you have a TV and a blu-ray
player that is connected to your TV. They both support CEC, that means the TV can
control the blu-ray player, and thus you can, with the TV remote, control the blu-ray
player as well.

Using CEC the raspberry-pi will also be able to control your TV and other CEC
devices. Once libCEC is installed, you can use a variety of commands to control
your TV. For instance echo "standby 0" | cec-client -s turns your TV off, and
echo "on 0" | cec-client -s turns your TV on. To see all available CEC clients,
type cec-client -l. For more commands go look online.

So here is how you install libCEC.

1. First run UPDATE.sh. It will update your raspberry-pi and then reboot.


2. Once rebooted, run SETUP.sh. It will install all the necessary packages and
    download the libCEC sources.

    Then go edit src/libcec/cmake/CheckPlatformSupport.cmake:
    2a. Replace the check_library_exists line with:
        check_library_exists(bcm_host bcm_host_init "" HAVE_RPI_API)

    2b. Replace include_directories line the with:
        include_directories(/opt/vc/include /opt/vc/include/interface/vcos/pthreads /opt/vc/include/interface/vmcs_host/linux)


3. Then run PREPARE.sh to build the first part of the project.
    3a. Move contents of /libcec/build/src/libcec/build into /libcec/build/src/libcec/
        if you have to.


4. Finally run BUILD.sh to install libCEC.
