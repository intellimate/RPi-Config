INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING IZOU ON YOUR RASPBERRY PI

These scripts contained in this folder set up your raspberry pi to run Izou. That
means it removes certain folders and creates new ones; those where izou will run from.
Further more it creates a daemon that runs izou and registers it with the start up 
services of the raspberry pi. That means Izou will by default always run and be started as soon
as the raspberry pi boots up. Here are the steps to achieve all this:

1. Run the SETUP.sh script from the home directory, with sudo rights

2. Move the INSTALL.sh script into /izou/config (created by the SETUP.sh script)

3. Move izou.jar into the /izou/izou directory (created by the SETUP.sh script)

4. Run INSTALL.sh with sudo rights

Now you will have izou running in the background all the time and being started up
when the raspberry pi starts up.
